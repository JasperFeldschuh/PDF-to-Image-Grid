# PDF-to-Image-Grid
##  General Use Cases:  
This program will convert a multi page pdf into a grid containing screenshots of every desired page. I use this in conjunction with goodnotes on my ipad to combine all lecture slides onto a single page for easy viewing and note taking. With google drive for desktop, it is possible to save the image directly to the cloud where it can be easily accessed from any device.

##  Instructions For Use:
**To run the program, you must set the location for the file to save to.**   

When opening the program, first set the number of columns desired in the grid. By default, the program will include every page in the pdf. The "Exclude Pages" button allows you to list pages that will be left out of the grid. From there, press "Generate Grid" and follow promts to complete.
